### Hi,

I'm an aspiring programmer from the DMV (D.C., Maryland, Virginia) area with a passion for graphics and artificial intelligence.

Stemming from a fascination in robots, visual effects, and CPU players in videogames I've had since I was young, I'm very invested in the mechanical world as well as the visual and written arts.
